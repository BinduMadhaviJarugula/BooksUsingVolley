# BooksUsingVolley :blush:
This application is used to display all the books which are present in the given API :thumbsup:.
This application uses one of the third party libraries i.e.,Volley to display data and to do background tasks.
When image is on clicked then it redirects to the next activity that describes all the information about the selected book.:raised_hands:
Using third party library is the main aspect of this project.
And all the images in the application are displayed in the RecyclerView which is the latest version of the ListView :blush:.
This is the basic application and which can be understandable for the starters :blush:
